PROJECT TIMING

Approximative planning for the Neuromancer/Resonanz 1.0

- create working stand-alone version for windows (swt gui) and linux (initially just command line)
  by then end of August 2015
- finish measurements and testing/finetuning parameters in one week and test basic methods
- implement:
   - model clusters for training data
   - hmm based multistep learning/approximation
   - bayesian neural network
- generate youtube vides showing results of neuromancer


FURHER PLANNING

Version 2:
- deep learning: GB-RBM+BB-RBM for pictures
  => feature vectors, autoencoder and 
     dynamic generation of pictures from feature vectors
     that has good ability to move brain towards target state
- sound: parameterized generation (FM) and learning 
  how different sound parameters has effect on measured values
- HMM model of IA Muse measured values, brain signal localization codes

Version 3:
- differential equation models for predicting permanent changes
- narrative mode, telling larger "stories" using stimulation elements 
  that can have more significant impact to the brain
  [higher conceptual level stories can go 
   brain states go up and down (smiling, crying etc)]
