TODO

- write MuseOSC driver

- HMM based analysis and generation of N-step long probable stimulation sequences
  (sample N>2 HMM sequences and only generate model and try 
   to learn 1..N long sequence models if probability of sequence is high enough)
   

- move from second long "ticks" to 
  subsecond ticks and use it everywhere to get subsecond accuracy
  
- fix/text MC sampling code (speed): support non-real time rendering

- sync music well with video
  - encoding music into encoded videos (later afterwards using external ffmpeg command)
  
- decode theora+ogg video+audio files when measuring programs

- program RMS error: measure program RMS with random stimuli for comparision

- neurodynamic re-inforcement learning when assigning credits
  from multiple different stimuli
