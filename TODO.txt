   * stacked RBM autoencoders do not work that well and require too much computing power (too slow)

   => implement variational autocoder (VAE) (see docs) to synthesize pictures?
   

- HMM based analysis and generation of N-step long probable stimulation sequences
  (sample N>2 HMM sequences and only generate model and try 
   to learn 1..N long sequence models if probability of sequence is high enough)
   
- move from second long "ticks" to 
  subsecond ticks and use it everywhere to get subsecond accuracy

- get emotiv insight and add support for it
  
- create theora+ogg video+audio files when measuring programs
  (currently does not 

- improve sound synthesis modules (FM synthesis)
